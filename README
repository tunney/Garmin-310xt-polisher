This app aims to resolve some of the issues with the data produced by Garmin 310xts when the data is analysised 
in a program like Trainingpeaks WKO. There are a number of issues with the data but this application focuses on 
the two most promenient ones.

1) The inclusion of stopped time in elapsed time
2) The absence of data due to SMART recording
